# teiko_technical

Hello and thank you for inviting me to take the technical interview for the Teiko Engineering Internship. Below I will map the organization of my submitted files so that they are easier to find and use.

Within teiko_technical.zip there are three subfolders:

   - python_response_files
       - This folder contains saved versions of the output files that my python program generated. Frequency_analysis.pdf contains the complete version of my Python Part 2 analysis
  -  python_code_and_input
        - This folder contains my python code and the cell-count.csv input file required for running the code. The code header comment block contains usage instructions. This folder should be the working directory for running the code. Files generated by the program will be returned to this folder 
  - database_response_files
    - This folder contains a pdf of my responses to the database questions.
