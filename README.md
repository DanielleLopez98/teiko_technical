# teiko_technical

Hello and thank you for inviting me to take the technical interview for the Teiko Engineering Internship. Below I will map the organization of my submitted files so it they are easier to use.

Within teiko_technical.zip there are three subfolders:

   - python_response_files
       - This contains saved versions of the output files my python program generated. frequency_analysis.pdf contains the complete version of my Python Part 2 analysis
  -  python_code_and_input
        - This contains my code and cell-count.csv input file for running the code required for the Python section. The code contains usage instructions. This folder should be the working directory for running the code. Files generated by the program will be returned to this folder 
  - database_response_files
    - This contains a pdf of my responses to the database questions.
